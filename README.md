# Workshop: Python in Science and Research

Dive into the following topics

- Numeric Computation
- Data Visualization
    - basic plotting
- What you would like to do

## Up Front Preparations

As this is a notebook class, you should try to setup Python and Git on your machine before we start with the actual workshop.

### Git Installation
The course will be available in github. The most convenient way to fetch it and updates of it from there is installing a [Git Client](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Please refer to [Basic Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) for further information, how to work with `git`.


### Python Distribution Installation
The easiest way to do so is by installing the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.continuum.io/).
Just download and install the current distribution with Python 3.6 or higher as described [in the Anaconda Installation Instructions](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install).

Then test the Anaconda installation by running your first notebook:
Therefore 
- `git clone https://github.com/juliaeis/informatica-pfr-2017.git` and 
- run in a terminal:
```bash
$ jupyter-notebook
```
, open in your browser [The Jupyter Notebook for the initial Installation Test](./nbs/0-a-Test%20of%20the%20Installation.ipynb) and run it ... 
If all runs through and you see as output in the last cell `All looks good!` you are done!

### Additional Python Package Installation

Further on in the workshop the following additional packages are required. 
If you don't succeed to install them upfront, don't worry: If help is needed, we will have enough time to install them together in the course.
```bash
    conda install seaborn

    conda install -c scitools cartopy=0.15.0
    # or
    conda install -c conda-forge cartopy=0.15.1
    
    conda install --channel conda-forge geopandas
    
    conda install --channel conda-forge pandas

```

## Refresher - Python(3) Basics
If you need a refresher of your Python knowledge the [Interactive Python Tutorial](https://www.learnpython.org/) is a good starting point.

The Lectures 
- `Learn the Basics`: All and
- `Advanced Tutorials` 
    - Generators
    - List Comprehensions
    - Multiple Function Arguments
    - Sets
    - Partial functions

should be sufficient for attending the Workshop `IF PRO 02 Python f√ºr Wissenschaft und Forschung`.

Also [A whirlwind tour of Python](http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/a-whirlwind-tour-of-python.csp) is a good starting point.
